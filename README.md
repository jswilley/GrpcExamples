# GrpcExamples

 Example 1: a walk thru of https://azure.github.io/AppService/2021/03/15/How-to-use-gRPC-Web-with-Blazor-WebAssembly-on-App-Service.html. I added auth0 security as per https://damienbod.com/2019/03/06/security-experiments-with-grpc-and-asp-net-core-3-0/ and https://medium.com/@marcodesanctis2/securing-blazor-webassembly-with-identity-server-4-ee44aa1687ef.

 Example 2: a more complex protobuf w/ a entityframework, tests and automapper(not working yet).
  a. External Testing (similar to postman can be done with Grpcui).  See this article: https://anthonygiretti.com/2021/01/17/grpc-asp-net-core-5-discover-grpcui-the-gui-alternative-to-grpcurl/
